User Experience (UX)

User stories
The website is designed for potential employers to be able to quickly see what my main skills are. They will also be able to quickly see my area of experties and have an option to download my CV for deeper overview. 
I have made the website easy to navigate from the landing page with 'View my Work' button which will take the user to the 'About' page and from there I have used the navigation bar on top of each page. 
The color pallete used is minimal and I have made sure is repeated across the site so the user experience doesn't change between pages.


Features
The website consists of four pages. The homepage as the landing page. It consists on my name and my title and a button to take the user to the next page. 
A about page, which contains a brief introduction of my self, my skills set and my Teck stack. A projects page to shows the prjects I have worked on to show my skills in actions and a contact page with a contact from for the user to get in contact if they need to.
